# Nanite Clicker

An Incremental/Idle game heavily inspired by [Cookie Clicker](http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker) and built using ReactJS with Redux state management.

## Installing
1. Don't install this - it's not very good. I made it whilst learning the basics of React and Redux. There is no originality here and this is shameful plagerism of Cookie Clicker
2. If you really must install this, run `npm install` to get the required dependencies, then `npm run build` to generate the compiled resources
3. Copy the contents of the generated `build` directory to your deployment server

## Contributing
In the highly unlikely event that you wish to contribute to this project, please don't. It's not a serious project heading for publication and is only ever intended to be a means for me to learn the technologies it was built with, and to demonstrate to others my understanding of those technologies.
