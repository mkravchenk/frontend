    <h2>What makes a superhero?<a name="top"></a></h2>
    <p>
      A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do
      them in a way that a normal person couldn’t. So in order to be a
      superhero, you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a
      normal human being could possess, and you need to use that power to
      accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be
      considered a superhero.

    <p>
      For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police
      story or detective story or human-interest story. But if it’s a good guy
      with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story.
      If the good guy is doing something that a normal human being couldn’t do,
      couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.

    <p>Madara Uchiha</p>
    <p>
      Madara Uchiha (うちはマダラ, Uchiha Madara) was the legendary leader of
      the Uchiha clan. He founded Konohagakure alongside his childhood friend
      and rival, Hashirama Senju, with the intention of beginning an era of
      peace. When the two couldn't agree on how to achieve that peace, they
      fought for control of the village, a conflict which ended in Madara's
      death. Madara, however, rewrote his death and went into hiding to work on
      his own plans. Unable to complete it in his natural life, he entrusted his
      knowledge and plans to Obito Uchiha shortly before his actual death. Years
      later, Madara would be revived, only to see his plans foiled and
      ultimately, and finally, realizing the error of his ways and making amends
      with Hashirama before his final death.
