      Naruto (Japanese: ナルト) is a Japanese manga series written and
      illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a
      young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming
      the Hokage, the leader of his village. The story is told in two parts –
      the first set in Naruto's pre-teen years, and the second in his teens. The
      series is based on two one-shot manga by Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995), which
      earned Kishimoto an honorable mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award
      the following year, and Naruto (1997). <br>Naruto was serialized in Shueisha's
      magazine, Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1999 to 2014, and released in tankōbon
      (book) form in 72 volumes. The manga was adapted into an anime television
      series produced by Pierrot and Aniplex, which broadcast 220 episodes in
      Japan from 2002 to 2007; the English adaptation of the series aired on
      Cartoon Network and YTV from 2005 to 2009. Naruto: Shippuden, a sequel to
      the original series, premiered in Japan in 2007, and ended in 2017, after
      500 episodes. The English adaptation was broadcast on Disney XD from 2009
      to 2011, airing the first 98 episodes, and then switched over to Adult
      Swim's Toonami programming block in January 2014, starting over from the
      first episode. The English adaptation is still airing weekly on Adult Swim
      to this day. Besides the anime series, Pierrot has developed eleven movies
      and twelve original video animations (OVAs). Other Naruto-related
      merchandise includes light novels, video games, and trading cards
      developed by several companies. <br>Viz Media licensed the manga and anime for
      North American production and serialized Naruto in their digital Weekly
      Shonen Jump magazine. The anime series began airing in the United States
      and Canada in 2005, and in the United Kingdom and Australia in 2006 and
      2007, respectively. The films and most OVAs from the series were also
      released by Viz, with the first film premiering in movie theaters. Viz
      Media began streaming the two anime series on their streaming service Neon
      Alley in December 2012. The story of Naruto continues with Naruto's son,
      Boruto Uzumaki, in Boruto: Naruto Next Generations: Boruto wishes to
      create his own ninja way instead of following his father's.
